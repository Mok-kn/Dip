## Introduction

Our codes are based on MMDetection. Please follow the installation of MMDetection and make sure you can run it successfully.

### Major features

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).
